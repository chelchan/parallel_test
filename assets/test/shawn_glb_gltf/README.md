#Texture
Texture is wired, since bowser and blender uses different 3d engine, what I saw in the blender is not the same as in browser.
But at least, the web catches the texture (metalic+roughness) with proper lighting setting.

#Emission
Next step is emission, I guess I will need a cutsomized emissive map for each material. Still working on it.
